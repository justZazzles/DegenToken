# DegenToken Smart Contract

The DegenToken smart contract is an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token contract designed to offer enhanced functionalities beyond the standard features.

## Description

The DegenToken Smart Contract is a Solidity-based Ethereum smart contract that implements a token and item management system. It allows users to mint, transfer, and burn tokens, as well as redeem various in-game items using their tokens.

## Getting Started
